<p>In the begging, when i  came to this city, it was 2'O-clock night, there was a complete silence all around,streat dogs are moving in the streat,lamp post are falktuating,there was no human on that city. Suddenly, a sound came from a drak place thak,.. thak,.. thak..then i move towards it. And said, is anybody there but there is no reply ..and the same sound is coming from the same place, at that moment I get feared and a feeling come heart that something is going to be wrong. My heartbeat goes up,my legs were frogen, my throght were choked,i am unable to speak.Then i pickup a stone from the streat and through towards it then immidiatly a yelling sound came and a dark bold  black cat came out from that dark place and crossed my way. Then first i cooldown myself and wait for a moment.After that i moved forward to find a hotel for my residence but there was no hotel all around.After searching a lot, i have found a hotel which is very old and small hotel. Then i go to the reception of that hotel and ask for a room.When i asked that  he start looking towards me in very horrible manner.His eye were red like he had not slept  for several mounths.He asked me that have you any identity card. I said, yes. Then he directly gave me a key and say go straight,room number 32.when i reached to room number 32 then i got surprised that it looks like a five star hotel room.All the things are new and clean.when i saw the hotel from out side i have imagied that it is not a hygenic hotel but i was wrong. It was a horrible night of my life.</p>
<p>
Next morning, when i wake up then i start thinking about the last night.It was simply a horrible night for me. I also start thinking that why it is happen with me,is i am a cowad or i am so tired.The answer comes within from me that i am so tired that's why it happen.</p>
<p>Then i went to bath and start dressing up for my new college but i am so nurves. After dressing up, i went to the the college by bus. when i step down from the bus and going toward the college,the student of that college started looking at me like that i am an alian. i got nurves and start thinking about my hair and dress.Whether i have properly combed my hair or not,or i have wear a wrong uniform. I start continueing in the same direction and went near to the notes board and started reading the notices.</p>
<p>From that notics board, i know that my class is on the first floor,room number 13. Then i directly moved toward my class room. when i reached towards my class room,i saw that some students were already there. I went to the class and take a vacant seat. In my seat nobody had seated except me. The professor came into the class and give his introduction and started taking the introduction of students. My tern also came and i introduced myself.Then professor started his lacture.After that class is over and student start murmuring but nobody is interested to talk with me.At that time I was feeling very alone. I was not happy with this college because nobody was talking with me. I was missing my old friends and my sweet family.All students were busy  in them selfs.</p>
<p>After that class is over and i came back to my hotel. Then i take the lunch and take rest for few hours. Then i started finding a PG for my accomodation. After seaching a lot, i have got a good PG for me where i can accomodate. Then i taked my bag and settled in that PG.</p>  
    <p>
   I always think that i am little diffirent from other student. why i am thinking so.</p>
